## Coding Standards

### Power BI / DAX Standards 

- You should use human-readable names rather than any kind of technical naming convention, with spaces where you would expect to have spaces and all vowels present. For example, that means having names like [Sales Amount] rather than [Sales_Amount] or [SlsAmt]; similarly, prefixes like ‚ÄúDim‚Äù and ‚ÄúFact‚Äù might make sense to you but won‚Äôt mean anything to your users.

- You should use the correct business terminology, the terminology that your users will know and understand, rather than just make up some names that seem appropriate. Your users might not understand what [Total Sales Value] is if the generally accepted term is [Net Sales Amount].

- The names you use should be consistent across all datasets that contain the same data. That means that if you have a table called Sales in one dataset it should be called Sales in every other dataset that you build from the same data source, not Transactions, FactSales or something else.
### File Organization

- **Semantic Model**: Keep related tables and measures organized
- **Report Pages**: Use descriptive names for report pages
- **Visuals**: Ensure consistent styling across all visuals
- **Data Sources**: Document any changes to data source connections

### Documentation

- **README Updates**: Update README.md for any new features or changes
- **Code Comments**: Add comments for complex logic
- **Measure Descriptions**: Include descriptions for custom measures
- **Change Log**: Document significant changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Test with Sample Data**
   - Ensure all measures calculate correctly
   - Verify all visuals display properly
   - Test filter interactions

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Check query performance with realistic data volumes
   - Ensure refresh times are reasonable
   - Test with different data sizes

3. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Test on different screen resolutions
   - Verify mobile responsiveness if applicable
   - Check in both Power BI Desktop and Service

### Test Data

- **Never use production data** in development or testing
- Use anonymized or sample data when possible
- Document any test data requirements

## Pull Request Guidelines
